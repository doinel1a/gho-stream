# GhoStream | Hackathon LFGHO

GhoStream allows users to use their assets as collateral to borrow GHO in a continuous stream. This novel approach not only ensures a better alignment with your income flow but also introduces an innovative method for making payments, leveraging the concept of continuous streams. By integrating the stability of traditional collateral with the flexibility of streaming finance, GhoStream paves the way for a more predictable and less risky financial future.

- **Innovative Payment System**: Unlock new payment possibilities, enabling users to pay through continuous streams, simplifying financial transactions.
- **Reduced Risk**: The continuous nature of the debt allows for better prediction of risk factors, offering a more secure way to manage borrowed funds.
